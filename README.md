## TODO / Things I would change with more time
- I could'nt get the right TS type for event objects
- I am making an unnessary API call because I didn't realize I could get the show and seasons and episodes all in one shot with a certain url param until I was almost out of time
- Would do more code cleanup and fix the styling more

- Made with <3 by Jeane Ramos
